This project aims to reimplement certain parts of the Pok√©mon games. In particular the combat and capture system. 
It can be considered as a reverse engineering project as I've had to analyze how the game works in order to reproduce it.
The game runs exclusively inside of the terminal.
In order to keep it simple, I will limit myself to the rules of Gen I, that is to say the Red / Blue / Yellow versions.
I have recreated many mechanics, including pokemon fights, items, pokeshops, pokecenters, pokemon leveling, pokemon catching and more.
The most important missing features include status effects (like poison or fire) and temporary stat changes.
